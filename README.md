# Flutter App with Node.js and MySQL API

This Flutter application integrates with a Node.js backend and MySQL database to provide various functionalities, including user authentication, face recognition, image uploading, wallet management, and in-app purchases for additional storage.

## Features

1. **Authentication:** The app starts with a login/signup screen. Users can log in with their credentials or sign up for a new account.

2. **Face Registration:** Upon signing up, users are prompted to register three facial images along with their username. This data is stored securely in the database for future authentication purposes.

3. **Image Uploading:** Users can upload images via the app. During the upload process, the app checks if the image contains a recognizable person. If it does, the image is uploaded with the name of that person. Otherwise, the image is uploaded normally.

4. **Wallet Management:** The app includes a wallet feature where users can view their available storage space and manage their files.

5. **In-App Purchases:** Users have the option to purchase additional storage space through in-app purchases. This feature allows users to expand their storage capacity as needed.

## Installation

1. **Backend Setup:** Set up the Node.js backend and MySQL database. Ensure that the backend API endpoints for user authentication, face registration, image uploading, wallet management, and in-app purchases are properly configured.

2. **Flutter Environment:** Make sure you have the Flutter SDK installed on your machine. You can follow the [official documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for installation instructions.

3. **Dependencies:** Navigate to the Flutter project directory and run `flutter pub get` to install the required dependencies listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file.

4. **Configuration:** Update the API endpoint URLs in the Flutter app to point to your backend server. Ensure that the app can communicate with the backend APIs for seamless functionality.

5. **Run the App:** Connect your device or use an emulator, then run `flutter run` in the project directory to launch the app on your device/emulator.

## Usage

1. **Login/Signup:** Upon launching the app, users are presented with a login/signup screen. They can either log in with existing credentials or sign up for a new account.

2. **Face Registration:** During the signup process, users are prompted to register three facial images. This step is necessary for authentication using facial recognition.

3. **Image Upload:** Users can upload images via the app's interface. The app automatically detects if the uploaded image contains a recognizable person. If so, the image is tagged with the person's name before uploading.

4. **Wallet:** Users can access the wallet feature to view their available storage space and manage their files. They can also purchase additional storage space through in-app purchases if needed.

5. **Logout:** Users can log out of their account to securely exit the app.
